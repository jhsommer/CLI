This project was made for a university exam.
First and foremost, the whole project is not optimally refactored because unfortunately I was running out of time. As soon as this project was graded I want to refactor the whole project, so that the code is more readable.

To use the project just clone this project and use the given commands with "dotnet run -- command" in the console. All commands can be found in the help.txt or with a empty command.
